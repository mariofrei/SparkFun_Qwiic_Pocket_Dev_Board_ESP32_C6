With the smart watch Qwiic stack assembled (say that five times fast), board definitions and libraries installed, we can upload the smart watch code to the Qwiic Pocket Development board. Copy the code below into a blank sketch or you can download it from the [GitHub repository]().

Now select the board (SparkFun Qwiic Pocket Development Board - ESP32-C6) and the Port and click the "Upload" button. Once the code finishes uploading, you should see a clock display on the Qwiic Micro OLED screen.
