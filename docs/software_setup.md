With the Qwiic Pocket Dev Board connected to our computer, it's time to set up the boards package in Arduino.

## Installing espressif Arduino Boards

The espressif ESP32 Arduino Boards package includes the Qwiic Pocket Development Board - ESP32-C6 (and Thing Plus version). Install it by navigating to the Boards Manager tab on the left of the IDE, then search for "espressif" and install the latest version of the ESP32 boards package as the screenshot below shows. This assumes the use of Arduino 2.x. Legacy users (Arduino 1.8x and previous) can find the Boards Manager tool in File/Tools/Boards Manager.
