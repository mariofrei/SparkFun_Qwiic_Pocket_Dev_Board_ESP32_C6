Now that we've installed the espressif boards package in Arduino, it's time to upload our first sketch to make sure everything is working properly.

## Example 1 - Blink & Hello World

This basic example blinks the blue STAT LED on the board and also prints out "Hello World" over the USB serial connection. Copy the code below into a blank sketch or download the example from the [GitHub Repository]().

!!! note "USB CDC On Boot Settings"

    Take note of the option labeled "USB CDC on Boot" when selecting the Board from the Tools menu. This option sets the serial outputs and defines their label for use in code. The SparkFun variants default to Enable USB CDC on boot which sets both <code>Serial</code> and <code>Serial0</code> as available serial ports. In this configuration, <code>Serial</code> corresponds to the direct USB/Serial converter on the chip (and the USB-C interface) and <code>Serial0</code> corresponds to the UART0 bus (default pins are 16 and 17).

    With either setting, <code>Serial1</code> is available and refers to the UART1 bus (default pins are 4 and 5).

Select the board (SparkFun Qwiic Pocket Development Board - ESP32-C6) and Port and click "Upload". After uploading, open the [serial monitor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/arduino-serial-monitor-windows-mac-linux) with the baud set to **115200** and you should see "Hello World" print out along with the STAT LED on the board blinking every two seconds.
