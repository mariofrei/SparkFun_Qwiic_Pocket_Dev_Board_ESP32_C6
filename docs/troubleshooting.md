## USB CDC on Boot Settings

Take note of the option labeled "USB CDC on Boot" when selecting the Board from the Tools menu. This option sets the serial outputs and defines their label for use in code. The SparkFun variants default to Enable USB CDC on boot which sets both <code>Serial</code> and <code>Serial0</code> as available serial ports. In this configuration, <code>Serial</code> corresponds to the direct USB/Serial converter on the chip (and the USB-C interface) and <code>Serial0</code> corresponds to the UART0 bus (default pins are 16 and 17).

With either setting, <code>Serial1</code> is available and refers to the UART1 bus (default pins are 4 and 5).
